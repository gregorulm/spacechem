SpaceChem: How to Defeat the Stage 9 Boss

In the setup illustrated by the screenshots in this folder, the following 
procedure defeats the final boss:

First, notice that only one of the thrusters is active. This exploits the
behavior of the enemy. Your ship steers to the right automatically, and it
will stay there. Now, keep an eye on the omega-missile launcher: whenever
the storage for H_2 is 7/8 full, hit the D switch briefly to make the Xe
atom travel down to the VGM laser reactor. Right after the Xe atom has
left the busy loop it was trapped in, deactivate the D switch again. Your
spaceship will now fire a laser which will "phase-lock" the enemy. An 
omega missile will be fired, which will hit the enemy while it is trapped
in that state. Repeat these instructions.

You have to hit the enemy ship ten times to win this fight. The system that
was set up will produce the required molecules so quickly that the enemy
won't get the chance to attack. Instead, it will remain locked on the right
side of the screen, taking one omega rocket after another. It may happen
that an asteroid is in the path of the rocket. You are welcome to ignore
this. If the omega rocket hits the asteroid, both the rocket and the
asteroid will be destroyed. However, in the unlikely case that your ship
will be hit, the damage dealt by the asteroid is insignificant.

After ten hits, the fight is over. Your reactors will stop moving. However,
the enemy ship may fire a laser at that point, which you won't be able to
defend yourself against. This is likewise irrelevant.
